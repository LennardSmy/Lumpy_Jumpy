# Lumpy Jumpy
## Vertical Jumping Game by Lennard Smyrka

I created this game with pygame libraries and took inspiration from the famous Doodle Jump game. 

I have included several features: 
- you can move the player by usind the a" and "d" keys on the keyboard
- I included an **info panel** on the top part of the screen that sows the **current score** and the **highscore**. 
   - once you reach the highscore there is a white bar accross the screen with "HIGHSCORE" written under it to make it more salient that the previous highscore is approaching.
- platforms that the player can use to "climb up" and gain a higher score. 
    - platform appear randomly but with a max distance to the previous so the player can always jump to the next one
    - platforms spawn in various sizes from the beginning
    - starting from a score of 500 the another type of moving platforms start spawning randomly 
- enemy in form of a bird animation that moves horizontally accross the screen starts spawning randomly after 1000 points
- sound effects are included: jump, death, background music
- game over screen and transition: once the player has fallen off the screen you hear the death sound effect and there is a fading transition into the game over screen where the player can read the achieved score, a statement that the game is over and the advice that by pressing the space bar the game starts again from the beginning. 

I hope this game is to your liking and that you may as well have fun trying it out.
